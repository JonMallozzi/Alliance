# Alliance
Alliance is an open source mmo all about survival, building bases, looting, questing, raiding and doing things with your alliance. The goal is to loot up and conqure the world in pvp and pve.

### Why Open source?
I made the game open source besides the assets and security files so I could put it on my resume and portfolio. Instead of making a game that is half finished and never releasing it, I would rather have the project be public to gain some credit when applying for jobs in the future. Another reason is this project is aimed to be good tool to teach people game dev and how to create an mmo. This project will be used blogs and youtuber series by me. The last open source goal is to have game be completely transparent to the community with all features added to game and how the game works.

Just because it is open source that does not mean I am looking for help as this is a solo dev project but I would love issues to be created for bugs or pull request to patch out methods for cheating and hacking. You can help ensure a good playing experience if you see issues in the code.

### Tech Stack
Game: Written in Java and using Vulkan, DX12, and Metal grahics apis\
Website: Typescript and Angular with WASM running the Java game\
Backend: Java Spring and Rest for the api\
Database: Couchbase and a Redis Cache\
Other Servers: Written in Java from scratch

### Why Java and Angular?
No particular reason I just wanted to brush up and improve my java and angular skills when I created this project. Also unity is a very powerful game enginge written in c# and I am curious since java and c# are very simular, can java could make just as powerful of a game enginge.
